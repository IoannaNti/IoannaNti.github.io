I am a **Postdoctoral Researcher** at [Queen Mary University of London](https://www.qmul.ac.uk), working on the [RAIDO project](https://raido-project.eu/).  
Within RAIDO, I contribute to the development of **Distill-AI**, a toolbox for energy-efficient AI models in computer vision and time-series. My research interests include **computer vision**, and more recently, **vision–language models**.

I completed my PhD in Computer Science at QMUL (2020–2024), where my thesis explored **efficient spatio-temporal modeling for action recognition in videos**, supervised by [Dr. Georgios Tzimiropoulos](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gDUMSB0AAAAJ&hl=en).  
Before my PhD, I interned at the [Samsung AI Centre, Cambridge](https://research.samsung.com/aicenter_cambridge), and I hold a BSc in Physics and an MSc in Electronics and Information Processing from the University of Patras, Greece.
