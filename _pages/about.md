I am a final-year PhD student at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), UK, where I have focused on spatiotemporal action detection under the supervision of Dr. Georgios Tzimiropoulos. I have submitted my thesis and am currently awaiting my viva. In addition to my studies, I work as a research fellow on the RAIDO (Reliable AI and Data Optimization) European project at QMUL, which you can learn more about [here](https://raido-project.eu/). Prior to my PhD, I completed a 9-month internship at the Samsung AI Centre in Cambridge, UK. I hold a BSc in Physics and an MSc in Electronics and Information Processing, both from the University of Patras, Greece.
